## Testing

## Introduction
Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are put under various tests to determine whether they are fit for use. It determines and ascertains the quality of your code.

- Unit tests were used.
- Test directories follows directories of ./farm
- Due to lack of time, I only tested the builder patterns and only the happy paths.
- Furthermore, Mocking should've been used for non-tested modules.
