# Docstrings
A Python docstring is a string used to document a Python module, class, function or method, so programmers can understand what it does without having to read the details of the implementation.

## Convention:
[PEP257 - Docstring Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/#:~:text=A%20docstring%20is%20a%20string,module%20should%20also%20have%20docstrings.)
