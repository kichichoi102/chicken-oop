# chicken-oop
Based on OOP oriented concepts in Python I should create a model (python script) of a chicken.

add doc of WHY i did builder + visitor

Visitor:
chicken - domain class
if feed, mate was part of chicken class, 
 - adds coupling to domain and actions
 - can add actions without interfering the other class

Builder:
 - can add new attributes quickly
